# 🚗 Smart Parking Assistance Hub

## 📖 Project Description

The **Smart Parking Assistance Hub** is an innovative solution aimed at addressing the increasing challenges of parking space management in urban areas by leveraging advanced technologies such as React for the frontend, Python for backend processing, MongoDB for data storage, and OpenCV for real-time parking detection. This system offers users a seamless and intuitive platform to locate and reserve parking spots in real-time, with OpenCV analyzing live video feeds to detect available spaces. The React-based frontend provides an interactive interface displaying real-time parking data, reservation options, and GPS-based navigation to available spots, while MongoDB ensures efficient management of user data, availability status, and system logs. By streamlining parking operations and reducing the time and congestion associated with finding parking, this project contributes to the development of smarter, more sustainable cities. Developed by Dharshini V (Reg. No: 24MCR019), Kanaga Durga M (Reg. No: 24MCR049), and Karthikeyan P (Reg. No: 24MCR051) under the guidance of Dr. P. Vijayakumar, the project includes a comprehensive README detailing its features, usage instructions, and implementation.
